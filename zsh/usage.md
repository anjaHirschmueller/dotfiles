# How to use these files

## ./.zshrc:
I use thise file at my local computer. For installation of all the tools see https://github.com/pugengineer/iTerm2-ohmyzsh-powerlevel9k The biggest difference is, that I use powerlevel10k
Copy it to ~/.zshrc and activate it with `source ~/.zshrc``

## terminal/my-bash.sh:
At terminals I dispense of some plugins and some comfort of the powerlever10k template. Though I created this my-bash.sh for having a get everything I need script at terminals.

Simply use  this command and the terminal is ready for usage as I'm used to. 
`sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anjaHirschmueller/dotfiles/zsh/terminal/my-bash.sh)"
